        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <P>Welcome to our kitchen! This website was created from a simple love for sharing delicious, authentic flavors—starting with one of our favorites: Kabob Koobideh with Polo. We believe food brings people together, and this dish represents the warmth, tradition, and richness of Persian cooking.</P>
<p>Our goal is to make traditional recipes easy to follow, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone—whether you’re an experienced cook or just starting out. Here, you’ll find step-by-step instructions, helpful tips, and the story behind each dish we share.</p>
<p>We hope our Kabob Koobideh Polo recipe brings comfort, flavor, and a taste of authentic Middle Eastern cuisine to your table. Thank you for visiting, cooking with us, and being part of our growing community!</p>
